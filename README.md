High school student learning to code in Kotlin and C#. Not wanting to release any personal details so that's pretty much entirely it. This is an alt account of my main [Praenyth](https://github.com/Praenyth) so check there if you want actual projects but this is an alt used for only notes.

Not fluent in any coding languages yet, as I am still learning.
